## Running the test network

You can use the `./network.sh` script to stand up a simple Fabric test network. The test network has two peer organizations with one peer each and a single node raft ordering service. You can also use the `./network.sh` script to create channels and deploy chaincode. For more information, see [Using the Fabric test network](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_network.html). The test network is being introduced in Fabric v2.0 as the long term replacement for the `first-network` sample.

Before you can deploy the test network, you need to follow the instructions to [Install the Samples, Binaries and Docker Images](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) in the Hyperledger Fabric documentation.

Never Shite where you drink. Now, the chickens have come home to roost. There is very little clean drinkable water left on our planet. PVA's 'Forever Chemcials are in everything we consume, especially our water. This Hyperledger is designed to make sure that water is clean and fair, for all.
